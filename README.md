It's very simple.

1. `cd gpt-3_semantic_search && python Human_Filtering.py` to start.

It will resume from wherever the last person left off. So **please commit & push as soon as you finish your work**. If you face merge conflicts, open up VS-Code and make sure to "accept both" changes. 

3. To exit press `ctrl+c` (same on windows/mac/linux). Then **you must press `y` to save your changes**. Or you can press `n` to discard changes (there is no undo for this step!). 

4. Immediately commit & push your changes so others can build on your work. 

Thank you for your help!!
