        "Chatbot-Generated-Answer": "GPT-3 response:\nA finite state machine (FSM) is a model for understanding the behavior of a system by describing the system as occupying one of a finite set of states, moving between these states in response to external inputs, and producing external outputs. The FSM includes five components: a finite set of states, a set of possible inputs, a set of possible outputs, transition rules from one state to another (or self-loops), and methods for calculating outputs. When an FSM is implemented as digital logic, each state must be represented using bits; all inputs must be translated into bits; and all outputs must be translated into bits. Transition rules are complete so that given any state and any pattern or input bits there is always an assigned transition rule leading to another state. Output calculation can then be reduced to Boolean logic expressions. As an example, consider the abstract keyless entry system given in the context: There are four states - Locked (vehicle locked); Driver (driver's door unlocked); Unlocked (all doors unlocked); Alarm (alarm sounding). Inputs include push \"unlock\", push \"lock\", push \"panic\". In this case when starting from Locked pushing unlock once leads to Driver while twice leads to Unlocked while pressing lock will lead back to Locked regardless; pressing panic will lead to Alarm sounding regardless. This behavior can be outlined using next-state tables which map current input/state combination into the next state for the FSM.",
