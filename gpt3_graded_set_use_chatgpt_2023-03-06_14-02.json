A set of possible outputs\n4. A set of transition rules\n5. Methods for calculating outputs\n\nIn an FSM, when it receives an input while in a particular state, it follows a transition rule to move to another state and produce an output based on its new state.\n\nFor example, consider a keyless entry system for a car with three abstract states: \"locked,\" \"driver unlocked,\" and \"fully unlocked.\" When the user presses the \"unlock\" button while the car is locked (\"locked\" state), the FSM transitions to the \"driver unlocked\" state and unlocks only the driver's door (output). If they press it again, it transitions to the \"fully unlocked\" state and unlocks all doors (output).\n\nFSMs can be implemented using digital systems where all inputs, outputs, and states are represented as patterns using bits or Boolean logic expressions.\n\nIn conclusion, FSMS are useful models for understanding how systems behave by breaking them down into different states based on their inputs/outputs and transition rules.",
